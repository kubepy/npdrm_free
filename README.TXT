Place npdrm_free.prx in ms0:/seplugins/ and enable it in vsh.txt.
Restart VSH, now you can launch any official EBOOT.PBP without a license.

If a license is not found then a fake one will be created, otherwise the official license will be left alone.

If flash2:/act.dat is not found then a fake one will be created.

To allow PC Engine games to run, either enable the nodrm engine in Pro CFW or install nploader.prx and enable in game.txt.

Game software manuals that require a license will now work without a license using this plugin enabled in vsh.txt.

Licensed DLC should now work and should now be 6.20 compatible.
